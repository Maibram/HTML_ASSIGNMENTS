	<p> The sun shone brightly as the little girl skipped down the street. She was on her way to the park to play with her friends. She could hear their laughter in the distance, and she couldn't wait to join them. As she walked, she admired the flowers blooming in the gardens. She picked a dandelion and made a wish, blowing the seeds into the air.

	<p>She reached the park and saw her friends playing on the swings. She ran over and joined them, swinging higher and higher until she felt like she was flying. After a while, they got tired and decided to play a game of tag. They ran around the park, laughing and shouting, until they were all out of breath.
